# ear-training
Ear training is the process of connecting music theory with the sounds we hear. In other words, studying ear training is building a bridge between the language of music and the sounds that are designated by that language. 
The more we train our ear to recognize this connection, the better we get at playing music, because we learn to understand what we play and to anticipate musical structures.

This is a simple tool to train your ears to identify single notes being played.
